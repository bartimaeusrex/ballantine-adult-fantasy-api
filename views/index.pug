      div.description
        p Instructions as to how to make proper use of the BAF API.
        p Quick reference outside of the technical details:
        p The series ran from 1969-1974 and was edited by Lin Carter.
          |  There are 18 books "pre-series" that are spiritually if not
          | technically published under the Ballantine Adult Fantasy label,
          | but many of these were later reprinted and emblazoned with
          | the official unicorn colophon. In the series proper, there
          | were a total of 65 books published,
          | and two "post-series", for a grand total of 85 all told.
        p For the purposes of this API, only those first 18 are currently documented.
